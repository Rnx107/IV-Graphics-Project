# Obstacle Avoidance AI Mini-Game

A Python Pygame project where players dodge falling obstacles, with optional AI agent functionality.

## ðŸŽ® **Current Status: WORKING PROTOTYPE COMPLETE!**

**Last Updated: July 9, 2025**

The game is fully playable! A blue player dodges red falling obstacles in a black space environment.

## Development Stages

### âœ… Stage 1: Core Game (Manual Play) - **COMPLETED**
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Pygame window and main game loop
- [x] Player object and movement (A/D and Arrow Keys)
- [x] Falling obstacles with random spawning
- [x] Collision detection using pygame rectangles
- [x] Basic scoring system (points for dodged obstacles)
- [x] Game Over and Restart system (R to restart, ESC to quit)

### ðŸ”² Stage 2: Clean & Polish - **NEXT**
- [ ] Graphics and visual improvements
- [ ] Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- [ ] Sound effects (optional)

### ðŸ”² Stage 3: AI Agent (Optional) - **FUTURE**
- [ ] Rule-based AI for obstacle avoidance
- [ ] Advanced AI approaches (optional)

### ðŸ”² Stage 4: Documentation & Submission - **FUTURE**
- [x] Complete README documentation
- [x] Code comments and documentation
- [ ] Final testing and cleanup

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.13+ (virtual environment already set up in `myenv/`)
- Pygame 2.6.1 (already installed in virtual environment)

### Running the Game:
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "IV-Graphics-Project"

# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
source myenv/bin/activate

# Run the game
python main.py
```

## ðŸŽ® Controls

- **A / Left Arrow**: Move player left
- **D / Right Arrow**: Move player right
- **R**: Restart game (when game over)
- **ESC**: Quit game

## âœ¨ Features

### Current Features (v1.0 Prototype):
- **Smooth Player Movement**: Blue rectangle player with boundary checking
- **Random Obstacle Spawning**: Red rectangles fall from random positions
- **Real-time Collision Detection**: Game ends on player-obstacle collision
- **Live Scoring System**: Points increase as obstacles are successfully dodged
- **Game Over & Restart**: Instant restart capability with R key
- **60 FPS Gameplay**: Smooth animations and responsive controls
- **Clean UI**: Score display and control instructions

### Technical Highlights:
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Separate classes for Player, Obstacle, Game, and utilities
- **Modular Code Architecture**: Each file has clear responsibilities
- **Configurable Settings**: All game constants centralized in config.py
- **Event-Driven Input**: Responsive keyboard handling with pygame events
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of off-screen obstacles

## ðŸ§  Code Architecture

The project follows clean coding principles with:

- **`config.py`**: Centralized constants (screen size, colors, speeds, etc.)
- **`utils.py`**: Reusable functions (collision detection, text rendering)
- **`player.py`**: Player class with movement logic and boundary checking
- **`obstacle.py`**: Obstacle class with falling behavior and spawn methods
- **`game.py`**: Main game loop coordinating all components
- **`main.py`**: Entry point with error handling and setup

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance

- **Frame Rate**: Stable 60 FPS
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient obstacle cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Responsiveness**: Real-time input handling with no lag

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Development Phase

Ready for Stage 2 improvements:
1. Enhanced graphics and visual effects
2. Progressive difficulty scaling
3. Sound effects and background music
4. Particle effects for collisions
